## Features

-   **Full Hebrew Calendar:** Displays a grid-based calendar view for any Hebrew month and year.
-   **Intuitive Navigation:**
    -   Quickly navigate between months and years with arrow buttons.
    -   Click on the month or year title to open a selection list for rapid navigation.
    -   Use the "Jump to Date" feature with predictive text to find any date in a 50-year range.
-   **Highly Customizable:**
    -   Disable selection of past dates.
    -   Disable selection of Shabbat and Jewish holidays/fasts.
-   **Gematria Display:** All years and days are displayed in their traditional Gematria format.
-   **Easy Integration:** Built as a `DialogFragment` and distributed via JitPack for simple, plug-and-play usage.
-   **Lightweight:** Depends only on `Zmanim (KosherJava)` and standard AndroidX libraries.



## Installation

This library is available on JitPack. To add it to your project, follow these steps:

**Step 1. Add the JitPack repository**

Add the JitPack repository to your root `settings.gradle.kts` (or `settings.gradle`) file:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

**Step 2. Add the dependency**

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file. 

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.yt2178:DatePickerHebrew:1.0.4")
}
```

Sync your project with Gradle files.

## Usage

Using the `HebrewDatePickerDialog` is straightforward. Your `Activity` or `Fragment` needs to implement the `OnDateSetListener` to receive the selected date.

**1. Implement the listener:**
```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements HebrewDatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener {
    
    private TextView mySelectedDateTextView; // Example TextView
    
    // ... inside onCreate, find your TextView
    // mySelectedDateTextView = findViewById(R.id.your_textview_id);

    @Override
    public void onDateSet(JewishCalendar selectedDate, String formattedDate) {
        // A date has been selected!
        // The dialog returns both the formatted string and the JewishCalendar object.
        
        // Display the result directly in your TextView
        mySelectedDateTextView.setText(formattedDate);
    }
}
```

**2. Show the dialog:**
```java
// Inside a button's OnClickListener or any other event
button.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    HebrewDatePickerDialog dialog = new HebrewDatePickerDialog();
    dialog.setOnDateSetListener(this); // 'this' refers to your Activity/Fragment
    dialog.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "HebrewDatePickerDialog");
});
```
## NEW NEW NEW!!!
Customization (Advanced Usage)
You can chain methods on the Builder to customize the dialog's behavior.
Example: Disable past dates and holidays
This is useful for booking or scheduling applications where users should only select future, available dates.
```Java
button.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    new HebrewDatePickerDialog.Builder()
        .setDisablePastDates(true)
        .setDisableHolidaysAndShabbat(true)
        .setOnDateSetListener(this)
        .build()
        .show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "HebrewDatePickerDialog");
});
```
When `setDisablePastDates(true)` is used:
-   Past days in the calendar will be grayed out and unselectable.
-   The back-navigation buttons will be hidden when viewing the current month.
-   The month, year, and "Jump to Date" selection lists will only show future options.


When setDisableHolidaysAndShabbat(true) is used:
-   All Shabbatot, Jewish holidays (Yom Tov), and fast days (Taanit) will be grayed out and unselectable.
